# 2Warm

## Description
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

## Prerequisites
This conversion can be done by hand, but python or an online binary conversion tool are preferable.

## Solution
I am most comfortable with working with python, and so I chose to use it to solve this problem as well. I started by issuing the *python* command in my terminal to bring up the interactive prompt. Once up, I typed the following:

```
bin(42)
```

Removing the 0b at the beginning of the output and placing the remaining into the picoCTF{...} format solves the problem.
